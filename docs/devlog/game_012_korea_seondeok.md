## 2026-02-26: Playtest Game 12 — Korea (Seondeok)

### The Setup
Started a new game as Korea, led by Seondeok. Korea is a science powerhouse, relying on their unique Seowon district (replaces Campus, must be built on hills, +4 base adjacency but loses adjacency if placed next to other districts). The strategic goal was clear: secure a strong, defensible core, spam Seowons, and ride a massive science lead to victory. The difficulty was high, and the map was unforgiving.

### Turns 1-50: A Promising Start
The initial settlement, Gyeongju, was placed on a solid coastal spot (Turn 1). Early exploration revealed a transition from jungle to tundra and desert floodplains to the south. The strategy was to secure the immediate area before expanding. 

By Turn 41, the core was stable, and the focus shifted to completing a Settler and healing the starting Warrior, which had been fending off early barbarian incursions. The science output was a modest 3.5, but the foundation was laid.

By Turn 50, score was 29, still with just the capital. The early game was slow, hindered by barbarian pressure that demanded military attention over infrastructure.

### Turns 51-100: Expansion and Consolidation
Expansion finally kicked in. By Turn 60, a second city was founded, and science started to creep up. The strategy shifted to securing the peninsula.

Turn 81 marked a significant milestone: the military was solidifying, and a Trader was produced in Gyeongju to boost the economy. Science hit 9.4.

By Turn 100, the third city, Gangneung, was established, securing the peninsula and providing access to more resources. Science reached 14.6, and gold income was a healthy +10 per turn. The core was taking shape, but the looming threat of Persia to the north was becoming apparent.

### Turns 101-160: The Golden Age of Science
This period saw Korea's science engine roar to life. The strategic focus was entirely on out-teching neighbors while maintaining a defensive posture.

Turn 121 saw a major Persian attack. However, the attack broke against the walls of Gwangju and the concentrated fire of Korean Archers (soon upgraded to Crossbowmen). The cost to Persia in advanced units was high, while Korea suffered minimal losses.

By Turn 140, the core was secure, and science was booming at 30.3. A trade relationship with Scythia (Tomyris) provided steady income and a diplomatic buffer. The goal was to reach the Industrial era as quickly as possible.

Turn 160 was the peak. Korea had 4 cities, a solid military of Crossbowmen and Man-At-Arms, and a science output of 32.5. The long-term objective was to reclaim the continent's southern riches.

### Turns 161-190: The Persian Juggernaut
The turning point came around Turn 170. Despite a science output of 44.7 and a seemingly secure core, the geopolitical reality was grim. We entered a Renaissance Dark Age.

Turn 178 brought disaster. A massive Persian army, armed with Bombards, Knights, and Pike & Shots, overwhelmed the capital, Gyeongju. The loss of the capital shattered the scientific victory condition. The strategy instantly shifted from peaceful growth to desperate, unadulterated defense.

The defense centered on Gwangju and Gangneung. We founded a 5th city, Gongju, in the deep south as a desperate fallback position (Turn 183). We threw everything at the Persian siege, successfully destroying their Bombard (Turn 183), but the sheer volume of advanced Persian units was overwhelming.

### Turns 191-216: The Collapse
Turn 191 was the fatal blow. Gwangju, our second-best city and the linchpin of our defense, fell. This took almost all of our remaining science output with it. 

Gongju, the newly founded southern city, immediately began bleeding loyalty due to the immense pressure from the now-Persian and Free cities surrounding it. By Turn 196, Gongju flipped to a Free City, leaving Korea as a tiny, two-city rump state (Gangneung and Yangsan).

The final 20 turns (196-216) were an exercise in futility. We sued for peace with Persia, which they accepted, but the damage was irreversible. We were reduced to a population of 8, with a science output of 24.2, while Scythia and Persia fielded massive armies of Line Infantry and Cavalry. We spent the remaining turns holed up behind walls, hoarding Niter to upgrade a single Man-At-Arms to a Musketman, playing a game of quiet endurance while the AI superpowers fought over the remains of our empire.

### Post-Mortem and Lessons Learned
1. **The Danger of the Dark Age:** Entering a Dark Age right as a hostile superpower borders you is a death sentence. The loyalty pressure makes defending newly captured or border cities nearly impossible.
2. **Science Isn't Everything:** While our science output was high relative to our size, it wasn't enough to field units capable of stopping a dedicated, numerically superior invasion from an AI that had clearly snowballed. We needed walls and Encampments earlier.
3. **Diplomatic Isolation is Fatal:** We failed to secure meaningful alliances. While we traded with Scythia, we had no defensive pacts. When Persia attacked, we fought alone.
4. **Early Expansion Matters:** We were too slow to expand in the first 50 turns. The delay in getting the second and third cities up and running cost us the critical momentum needed to build a resilient core before the Renaissance era.

The game was conceded on Turn 216. The Korean dream of a Seowon-powered utopia was crushed under the treads of Persian Knights.
