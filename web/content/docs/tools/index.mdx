description: Complete reference for all 76 MCP tools
---

The civ6-mcp server exposes **76 tools** through the Model Context Protocol. Each tool is available to any MCP-compatible AI client.

Tools are organized into three categories based on their behavior:

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| [Query](/docs/tools/query) | 34 | Read-only inspection of game state |
| [Actions](/docs/tools/actions) | 34 | Commands that modify game state |
| [System](/docs/tools/system) | 8 | Game lifecycle and turn management |

## Conventions

- **Required parameters** are marked with a red asterisk (*)
- **Optional parameters** show their default value
- **Read-only** tools are safe to call at any time without side effects
- **Action** tools modify the game (move units, set production, etc.)
- **Destructive** tools can significantly alter game state (end turn, load saves)

## Parameter types

All parameters use simple types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `string` | Text value |
| `integer` | Whole number |
| `number` | Decimal number |
| `boolean` | `true` or `false` |
